# Testcontainers *<sub>~~from hell~~</sub>*

This repository was used to test and configure the lib `testcontainer` for using it in Integration Tests.


After many attempts, just run the `firsttry` package *<sub>(it wasn't the first)</sub>* and see the black magic happening.

It should run JUST ONE F<sub>~~orThe~~</sub>KING mysql container for all tests
